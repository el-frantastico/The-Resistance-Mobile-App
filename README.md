# The-Resistance-Mobile-App
Based on the deduction game by Don Eskridge:

"The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no
player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the
resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination."

This project aims to create a mobile application for the game. Initially, it will be a helper app, meant to be used along with
the game board. In the end, it will be its own application, with features such as multi-phone play, computer AI, plot cards, etc.

I do not own ANY rights to this game and will only pursing this project as a hobby. Please do not try to sell or market.
